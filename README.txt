To start operating, it would be necessary to do 3 previous steps:
 
First step: import the database (file: sql.sql) of the project in which the first admin user will be created by default
with email test@test.com and password test123. 

Second step: change the config.php (./config/config.php) file of the project.
You will have to change the address of the file server to that of your localhost/virtualhost.
 
Third step: this third step will be done to upload video or music files. You will have to modify the php.ini file
and increase the size of the uploads.
 
Hopefully you enjoy this beta of the virtual teacher community.
